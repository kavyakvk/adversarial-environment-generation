Our project is the first known implementation of generating adversarial environments for multi-agent programs using a genetic algorithm (GA). We implement from scratch an environment simulator to test multiple foraging algorithms (including deep Q learning and biologically-inspired swarm algorithms) against our proposed GA. We also demonstrate significant improvement from co-evolving these multi-agent and genetic algorithms together.  

This repo contains the code, figures, and saved (pickled) simulations from experiments that accompany our work. The following is a breakdown of the folder structure:
